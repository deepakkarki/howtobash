# How to Bash
This repository is a collection of frequent **"How to's"** that command line newbies face. I'm creating this repository for personal reference, and for those who plan to get more comfortable with the Linux development environment. 

Most of the content will be of the format "How to ..." (eg. How do I automate my ssh scripts) and "How do I ..." (eg. check the memory being used by each process).

##Why

There are quite a few reasons behind this initiative, to break it down :

**Why deal with bash?** 

Programming and development are two different things. To be a better developer I need to know my tools better - they don't teach this at college. 

**Why not use reference books?** 

Current resources teach you topic by topic, many reference books and bibles available. I get bored reading before I get something meaningful. Here I introduce commands in context to problems, not the other way round. Once you have the hang of the basics, you'll know what to search for in the man pages / reference books.

**Why put it on Github?** 

There is a need for a community driven resource as such. Stackoverflow will help when you know the exact question to ask, here you will probably find solutions to questions you wouldn't think of asking. (Like when my friend introduced me to tmux a while back - such a life saver!)

##Note

**This will be beneficial to you if**

1. You already have some basic programming and scripting experience
2. Use linux - but are still primarily dependent on the desktop GUI to get your work done.
3. Understand that this is just to help you start, and not a replacement to indepth reference materials.
