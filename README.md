# How to Bash
This repository is a collection of frequent **"How to's"** that command line newbies face. I'm creating this repository for personal reference, and for those who plan to get more comfortable with the Linux development environment. 

Most of the content will be of the format "How to ..." (eg. How do I automate my ssh scripts) and "How do I ..." (eg. check the memory being used by each process).

The reasons behind this effort :
* Programming and development are two different things. To be a better developer I need to know my tools better - they don't teach this at college. 
* Current resources teach you from the tools perspective (i.e.) they cover it tool by tool, here I plan to tackle it problem by problem. (like how to deal with files, handle processes, set up network etc. and see which all tools are available for the job).
* There is a need for a community driven resource as such. Stackoverflow will help when you know the exact question to ask, here you will probably find solutions to questions you wouldn't think of asking. (Like when my friend introduced me to tmux a while back - such a life saver!)


> **All in all, if you are a developer just getting by with basic commandline knowledge (as I was a year ago) - you should find this most useful to become much more productive at your work.**
